## Unreleased

### Breaking — the root scope level is now a wildcard when NULL

`@holds` scope matching treated the **root** scope level as an exact match: an
assignment whose root scope column was NULL matched nothing, at any query scope.
Every level below the root already treated NULL as "all". That asymmetry is
gone. NULL now means "all" at every level, including the root, in all three
surfaces: the generated `<admin>_has_perm` SQL definer, the Go
`HoldsResolver.Resolve`, and the TypeScript `resolve`. `ResolveRoles` already
treated an all-empty scope as global, so roles and permissions now agree.

This is what makes a platform-wide scope expressible — an assignment with every
scope column NULL confers its permissions everywhere — and it is a
**privilege-escalation change for existing data**. Any active role assignment
that already has a NULL root scope column silently becomes cross-tenant on
upgrade. Assignments with a non-NULL root scope are unaffected: they gain no
reach, and they still do not answer a global (all-NULL) query.

**Before upgrading, find the at-risk rows.** For a rolestore declared as

```
rolestore admin {
  assignments role_assignments
  kind        principal_kind = "user"
  subject     user_id
  scope       tenant_id project_id
  rolejoin    role_id roles id key
  revoked     revoked_at
  permissions permissions
}
```

run:

```sql
SELECT ra.user_id, r.key, ra.tenant_id, ra.project_id
FROM role_assignments ra
JOIN roles r ON r.id = ra.role_id
WHERE ra.principal_kind = 'user'
  AND ra.revoked_at IS NULL
  AND ra.tenant_id IS NULL
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

Every row it returns becomes a cross-tenant grant. Scope them to a tenant, or
revoke them, before deploying. `HoldsResolver.GlobalAssignmentsSQL()` emits this
query for your own rolestore, and `demesne check <spec> <dsn>` now runs it and
reports `DANGER: N active role assignment(s) leave …` when any row exists.

### Added — permission implication in a vocabulary

A vocabulary permission may declare what else it confers:

```
vocabulary admin {
  permission platform:manage implies *
  permission tenant:manage   implies project:manage, billing:*, invitations:*
  permission project:manage  implies records:*, content:*
  …
}
```

An item is a permission of the same vocabulary, a `<domain>:*` wildcard for
every permission in that domain, or a bare `*` for the whole vocabulary.
Expansion is transitive; a cycle or an item matching no permission is a compile
error, reported by `Validate`.

The key is the ceiling and the assignment scope is the subtree, independently: a
`project:manage` role assigned at tenant scope reaches every project in that
tenant and still confers no `billing:*`.

All three surfaces are compiled from the one declaration. Go and TypeScript
expand a held permission into its closure inside `Resolve` (so `Holds` stays a
map lookup, and `Permissions()` now reports the **effective** set, not the
literally assigned one). A vocabulary with implications additionally emits
`auth.<admin>_perm_implied_by(p_perm text) RETURNS text[]` — the compile-time
reverse closure — and `<admin>_has_perm` tests
`r.<permissions>::text[] && <admin>_perm_implied_by(p_perm)`. A NULL permissions
column yields NULL and fails closed; an empty array is false. A vocabulary
without implications emits the previous `p_perm = ANY(r.<permissions>)`
unchanged and no new function, so specs that do not use the feature emit
byte-identical SQL.
